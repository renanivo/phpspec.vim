PhpSpec.vim
===========

Just a PhpSpec compiler for VIM

Installation
------------

As usual, you can install it with your prefered VIM plugin manager (like [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)).
If you want to install it by yourself, just copy the `compiler` folder to your `~/.vim` folder.

Usage
-----

```vim
:compiler phpspec
:make
```

If you want a deeper integration with PhpSpec, like shortcuts, take a look at [Herzult's plugin](https://github.com/Herzult/phpspec-vim). Feel free to use them together :smiley:.
